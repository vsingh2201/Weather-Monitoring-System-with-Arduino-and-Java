# Indoor vs Outdoor Weather Monitoring System with Arduino and Java
<br>
<p>I made an Indoor vs Outdoor Weather Monitoring System using the Grove Board and a Java program.This system compare indoor temperature and humidity values with the outdoor temperature and humidity values.The indoor weather data was obtained using the 2 sensors on Grove board: DHT11 and BMP280. DHT11
was used to obtain Temperature and Humidity data whereas the BMP280 was used to obtain
Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude. To get the Outdoor weather data, I used the Open Weather API in
my Java program.</p>

<p>The indoor temperature and humidity values are displayed on the terminal wheras the outdoor data for the city of Toronto is displayed on the GUI designed using JavaFX framework.</p>
