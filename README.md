# Indoor vs Outdoor Weather Monitoring System with Arduino and Java
<br>
<p>I made an Indoor vs Outdoor Weather Monitoring System using the Grove Board and a Java program.
The indoor weather data was obtained using the 2 sensors on Grove board: DHT11 and BMP280. DHT11
was used to obtain Temperature and Humidity data whereas the BMP280 was used to obtain
Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude. To get the Outdoor weather data, I used the Open Weather API in
my Java program.</p>
